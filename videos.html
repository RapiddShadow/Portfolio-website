<p>    Built a website for the locals of hoboken as a project. Where teenagers can be hired by adults to complete their daily chores that they would post on the website. Teenagers
    can apply to the job by submitting their resume and the job post owner can decide whether to hire them or not. This website had separate dashboard options for teen users and 
    adult users.
